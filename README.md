Guessing_game
=============

I'm still learning C++ and this is what I made with what I know.

It's a number guessing game, the code generates a random number 0-100.
The user must guess the number, he/she gets some hints to help him/her ([0,100]),
these change when a new number is entered.

When the number is guessed, the user can see how many attempts did it take him/her.

It should work on every platform, but currenty it's only compiled for windows.
