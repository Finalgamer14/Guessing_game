Guessing_game
=============

I'm still learning C++ and this is what I made with what I know.

It's a number guessing game, the code generates a random number 0-100.
The user must guess the number, he gets some hints to help him ([0,100]),
these change when a new number is entered.

When the number is guessed, the user can see how many attempts did it take him/her.

As much as I know this only works on windows.
